+ I started my internship in the midst of Singapore’s circuit breaker. Offices had to close, and everyone had to transit into a purely work from home environment. During this strange period, I joined foodpanda as a content intern. The internship lasted for 3 months, through the circuit breaker, so it ended up being a virtual one, which was a definitely interesting experience.
