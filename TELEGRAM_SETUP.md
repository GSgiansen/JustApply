# Telegram Bot Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** and search for `@BotFather`
2. **Start a chat** with BotFather
3. **Send the command**: `/newbot`
4. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Enter a name for your bot (e.g., "Daily Scraper Notifications")
   - Enter a username for your bot (must end with 'bot', e.g., "my_scraper_bot")
5. **Save the bot token** that BotFather gives you (looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

## Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

### Method 1: Using @userinfobot (Easiest)
1. **Search for `@userinfobot`** in Telegram
2. **Start a chat** with it
3. **Send any message** to it
4. **It will reply** with your chat ID (a number like `123456789`)

### Method 2: Using your bot
1. **Start a chat** with your bot (search for the username you created)
2. **Send any message** to your bot
3. **Visit this URL** in your browser (replace with your bot token):
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
4. **Look for the "chat" object** and find your `id` number

## Step 3: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. **Add these two secrets**:

   **Secret 1:**
   - **Name**: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your bot token from Step 1

   **Secret 2:**
   - **Name**: `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
   - **Value**: Your chat ID from Step 2

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Go to your repository's Actions tab**
2. **Find the "Daily Scraper" workflow**
3. **Click "Run workflow"** â†’ **"Run workflow"**
4. **Check your Telegram** for the notification

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding?

- Check that your bot token is correct
- Verify your chat ID is correct

### Getting "Forbidden" error?
- Make sure you've sent at least one message to your bot
- Check that your chat ID is correct

### Message not formatted properly?
